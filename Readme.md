# Micropuzzle

## ItÂ´s a POC at the moment so by careful by using

### A microfrontend Proxy which let you start at minutes to build your Application splittet into fragments.
### Have stable first byte by client always. lazy async load data when content its there

## Quick Getting start. 

Requirements: 
  - Redis

First of all you need some mircofrontend Servers. 

See at folder externalServices the are some examples for different frameworks: 

- [footer](/externalServices/footer) ==> react with styled components

## Configure your possible available Microfrontends
with `--microfrontends` (or over Environment `MICROPUZZLE_MICROFRONTENDS`) you can set the destination of an yaml-file. 
Inside this file you can configure with logic fragment have which url to load the content. [example](/config/frontends.yaml)

## Configure your frontend skeleton
with `--publicfolder` (or over Environment `MICROPUZZLE_PUBLICFODER`) you can set the folder where to find root index.html template
Inside this folder you can use normal html, css, js with should be global there. 

[take a look here](/public/index.html)

## How template html work
You have to set two template flag required: 
- {{.ScriptLoader}} => inside your head Tag to set .js loader
- {{.Loader}} => at the end of the body Tag (important have to be set after each  {{.Reader.Load "..." "..."}})

To load a microfrontend from ini file you have to insert  {{.Reader.Load "key inside your ini file" "logic unique name of this fronend space"}}

The `logic unique name of this fronend space` is importend. About this you have the possibility to change the content of this area. 


## How to change the Content from Client site (example button click)
[look here](/externalServices/footer_old/index.html)

At the end you have to send Custom Javascript events to load new Content. 
But a Typescript snippet will be generated for you. 
Unter the Managmenturl (default 3301). 
So if you start it local: 
http://localhost:3301/micro-puzzle-helper.ts

This snippet you can include into your Microfrontends. [example](./externalServices/footer/): 
- See generation Script (`genTypes`) at [package.json](./externalServices/footer/package.json)

This Code snippet will also have enum MicropuzzleFrontends where you find all keys from you [frontends.yaml](/config/frontends.yaml)

## Configure your possible available Microfrontends
with `--microfrontends` (or over Environment `MICROPUZZLE_MICROFRONTENDS`) you can set the destination of an inifile. 
Inside this file you can configure with logic fragment have which url to load the content. [example](/config/frontends.ini)

## Configure your frontend scarlett
with `--publicfoder` (or over Environment `MICROPUZZLE_PUBLICFODER`) you can set the folder where to find root index.html template
Inside this folder you can use normal html, css, js with should be global there. 

[take a look here](/public/index.html)

## How template html work
You have to set two template flag required: 
- {{.ScriptLoader}} => inside your head Tag to set .js loader
- {{.Loader}} => at the end of the body Tag (important have to be set after each  {{.Reader.Load "..." "..."}})

To load a microfrontend from ini file you have to insert  {{.Reader.Load "key inside your ini file" "logic unique name of this fronend space"}}

The `logic unique name of this fronend space` is importend. About this you have the possibility to change the content of this area. 


## How to change the Content from Client site (example button click)
[look here](/externalServices/footer_old/index.html)

At the end you have to send Custom Javascript events to load new Content
```
  const event = new CustomEvent('load-content',{
    bubbles: true,
    composed: true,
    cancelable: true,
    detail: {
      loading: "key inside your ini file,"
      content: "logic unique name of this fronend space"
  }})
  document.dispatchEvent(event);
```
